# 1YearPlan
This repository contains my daily programming tasks and projects as I work through my 2025 learning roadmap. Each folder corresponds to a week and contains well-documented code, solutions, and mini-projects.

# Daily Programming Tasks Repository

Welcome to my **Daily Programming Tasks** repository! This repository documents my day-by-day progress as I follow my 2025 learning roadmap for mastering programming, data structures, algorithms, and machine learning.

## 📖 Overview
This repository serves as:
- A place to track my daily tasks and solutions.
- A showcase of mini-projects and exercises.
- A reference for anyone looking to learn programming step by step.

## 🗓️ Learning Roadmap
I am following a structured 1-year plan with weekly milestones:
- **Week 1:** Introduction to C++ (Basics, Loops, Problem Solving)
- **Week 2:** Python Basics
- **Week 3:** Problem Solving with Python
- **...and more** leading to advanced topics like Neural Networks, GANs, and Deployment.

## 📁 Repository Structure
Each week has its own folder. Inside each folder:
1. **Day-wise Solutions:** Programs written as part of daily tasks.
2. **Mini-Projects:** Weekly projects to consolidate learning.
3. **Documentation:** Notes and references for understanding the concepts.


## 🌟 Highlights
- Daily progress tracking.
- Solutions to beginner and intermediate-level problems.
- Mini-projects to demonstrate concepts in action.

## 🚀 Goals
By the end of 2025, I aim to:
- Build a solid foundation in programming (C++ & Python).
- Solve 100+ coding problems on platforms like HackerRank.
- Create a portfolio with 5-6 major projects.
- Transition into advanced topics like machine learning and AI.
